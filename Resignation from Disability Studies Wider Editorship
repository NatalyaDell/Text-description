It is with great sadness that we are announcing today that we have resigned from the wider editorial board of Disability and Society. We are making this decision together as we both have a long association with the journal as members of ther board and published authors. 

Our commitment to the Journal means that this has been an extremely difficult decision for us both and one that we have taken time to consider. 

We can no longer support a journal that is now explicitly associated with a disassociation of the disciplines and activisms of Disability and Trans Studies. 

Our aim has always been to create communities in which these key areas of politics can be bought together in productive ways. However we no longer believe that this is possible as members of the wider editorial board. 

We remain committed to the principles of free speech and robust scholarship. And the need to develop humane, nuanced and inclusive discussion about the links between trans and disability politics. We look forward to working with researchers/activists and artists allied to the politics of diversity to create more incusive spaces for thought and action. 

Dan Goodley and Katherine Runswick-Cole.
